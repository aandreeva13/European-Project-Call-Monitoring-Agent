Projects under this topic will deliver common frameworks and reusable building blocks that can serve multiple sectors and use cases, reinforcing Europe\u2019s ability to bring AI-driven robotics to scale.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nWider and faster deployment of robotics, bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users.\nDevelopment and implementation of modular and interoperable integration frameworks and solutions, including standardized protocols for data, training and safety testing, evaluation and validation of robotic solutions in key use cases\nImproved competitiveness of European industries, notably SMEs via the development of advanced robotics systems, intelligent planning and control systems, user feedback rendering techniques and cutting-edge AI innovations\nScope:\nThe project will address the current European gap in system integration capabilities for robotics solutions addressing the various needs of industries. The project will aim at disseminating a deep understanding of state-of-the-art robotics components, including both hardware and software, and expertise in addressing interoperability issues for the upskilling of system integrators.\nTo maximise the impact and adaptability of deployed systems, the approach should consider the most appropriate tools to speed up integration processes and suitable AI design, training and inference methodologies, ensuring scalability, transferability, transparency, robustness, flexibility, and real-world applicability in diverse industrial environments, and should remain adaptable to the latest technological developments.\nIntegration frameworks will promote the use of energy-efficient AI models and hardware ('Green AI'), alongside carbon-aware deployment and operational strategies for robotic system. Where relevant, projects should contribute to open and widely recognised standards to foster interoperability and uptake across the robotics ecosystem. To enhance safety and performance, projects may include high-fidelity simulation environments or digital twins as testbeds for training, validation and verification, with measures to ensure smooth transfer from simulation to real-world deployment.\nBy bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users, these integrators will enable the creation of seamless, reliable and scalable robotics systems that can be easily adopted by industries, especially SMEs, thereby supporting more flexible and efficient production processes.\nThe project is expected to deliver:\nA deployable, modular integration framework, validated through at least three real-world industrial pilots covering different reference scenarios to demonstrate that the approach can be adapted to varied industrial needs and company sizes, including both SMEs and larger manufacturers. This framework should provide, for example, a common software layer, standard interfaces to connect to existing workflow and legacy system, possibly also to connect various robot components, coordinate multiple robots and link them with additional AI tools and IoT environments, as well as tested configuration templates and clear guidelines to ensure safe and efficient use.\nAn Integration Kit, building on this framework, which offers ready-to-use modules, example configurations and practical tools that help system integrators and companies to set up, test and run AI-enabled robotics solutions more quickly and with reduced technical effort.\nWhere relevant, high-fidelity digital twin testbeds should be linked to each pilot, allowing safe and realistic testing and training before deployment, and supporting a smooth transition from virtual models to actual production lines.\nReusable, datasets (compliant with relevant regulation and IP protection) and practical benchmark tasks, made available to the wider robotics and AI community, to support further development and comparison of new solutions while respecting European data protection rules.\nA clear Step-by-Step Adoption Guide aimed at SMEs and other end-users, providing easy-to-follow instructions, practical checklists and examples to help companies plan, budget and implement AI-driven robotics in a safe and cost-effective way, even if they have limited in-house expertise, and including guidance to navigate regulatory compliance and certification.\nConcrete contributions to relevant open standards and clear guidance on certification pathways, to help ensure compliance with European regulations and build trust in the safe use of AI in robotics. Projects are expected to make full use of existing robotics resources and assets made available through the AI-on-Demand Platform, such as the EuroCORE repository and other relevant shared tools, to maximise synergies, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure broad dissemination and reuse of results within the European AI and robotics community.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA.",

The detailed specification and design of these challenges may be further refined during the first phase of the project in collaboration with industry partners.\nThe project will organize a multi-stage competition for each of the three identified technical challenges. Each stage of the competition is expected to present an increased level of complexity compared to the previous one. The approach for designing the competitive process, including the use of FSTP, should aim at maximising the impact.\nOne of the key use cases for this project will be the automotive industry, which should be explicitly included in proposals either as a primary focus or as a dedicated use case, demonstrating how advanced robotics can enhance production efficiency and adaptability in this sector. Other use cases alongside the automotive one are allowed and encouraged, to demonstrate the industry-agnostic nature and the transferability of the developed solutions to different industrial contexts.\nUser-industry companies from the manufacturing sector (including automotive) should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and actively support the FSTP recipients in achieving powerful and exploitable results that benefit their industry.\nOrganization of the Challenge:\nStage 1 \u2013 Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection of the 10 highest-ranked proposals for each of the three technical robotics skills, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, research organisation or public body secondary or higher education establishment, developer of robotics solutions, or a small team of organizations.\nStage 2 \u2013 Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 will receive a EUR 200,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 3 highest-ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 \u2013 Grand Finale (competition among Stage 2 winners): The 3 best teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 will receive a EUR 1,000,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges defined for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the team winning the grand finale in maximising the impact and uptake of its solutions.\nProposals must include a draft exploitation plan outlining how the solutions developed by the FSTP recipients will be taken up, with concrete support from the user-industry partners to ensure industrial relevance and future exploitation.\nThis scheme is repeated for each of the three technical challenges.\nThe consortium will ensure high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships, and will seek to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.\n\nTopic updates\n15 January 2026\nThe submission session is now available for: HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-18, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-17, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-HUMAN-02, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-03, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-08, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-06, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-02, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-12, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-09, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-11, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-19, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-HUMAN-01, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-14, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-15",

            "description": "Expected Outcome:\nThe Apply AI Strategy[1] proposes a comprehensive set of measures to notably harness the transformative potential of AI. It lays down targeted measures to boost AI use in key strategic sectors of the EU economy including healthcare, mobility and manufacturing for example. With challenges designed to spark breakthroughs in such strategic sectors, the current topic will directly support key activities of the Apply AI Strategy.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nSignificant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI Strategy's prioritised sectors driven by challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions.\nIncrease competitiveness and visibility of the relevant AI community within key application domains, and promote collaborative approaches for AI development in these domains, fostering the ecosystem.\nIncrease adoption of AI technologies across the following three key application domains: healthcare, advanced manufacturing (including AI-powered robotics) and in-vehicle autonomous driving.\nScope:\nThe Challenge-Driven AI Innovation Booster aims to drive significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI prioritised sectors through challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions. This initiative seeks to boost Europe's developer community and the adoption of powerful, trustworthy AI solutions in three strategic domains such as:\nIn healthcare - advanced AI will accelerate diagnostics and treatment plans, enhance robotic surgery, or improve patient care through predictive analytics.\nIn advanced manufacturing - advanced AI will optimize production processes, improve quality control and product design, or enable predictive maintenance.\nIn autonomous driving - advanced AI will enhance vehicle safety, improve navigation systems, or optimize traffic management. Provided sufficient quality of the proposals received, at least one selected project will focus on in-vehicle autonomous driving applications, in line with the Automotive Action Plan, ensuring coordination with the announced Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above.\nIt is expected to focus primarily on the definition and organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as on the accompanying support to the SMEs/teams taking part in each of the challenges.\nUser-industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in each consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and therefore support the challenge participants to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefiting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive, but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan focused on how the solutions developed by the third parties will be taken up, with support from the user-industry partners for their future exploitation.\nThe consortium leading the project is responsible for the various stages of the challenges. This consortium should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition (including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy) and, most importantly, the consortium should ensure that the teams competing for and receiving financial support to third parties have access to relevant data to fine-tune models and build high-impact solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where advanced AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with advanced AI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, each project consortium should organize a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small teams of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with advanced AI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\nStage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection for Stage 2 of the 10 highest-ranked proposals according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution is expected to be submitted either by a single SME, developer of advanced AI solutions, or a small team of organizations led by such SME.\nStage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive a EUR 300,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest-ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 \u2013 Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,250,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best-performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch a multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, and propose a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants in the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organizing the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organizing dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalized by a collaboration agreement after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, a total of EUR 3,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, EUR 9,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives and expected results. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore, dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.\n[1] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy",

            "description": "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nSignificant technology progress and innovation through challenge-driven approach in the fields of aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks.\nIncreased competitivity and visibility of the Generative AI community in Europe, in demonstrating their capability to achieve challenging tasks within the aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication sectors.\nIncreased adoption of Generative AI in aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks through tangible progress and achievement demonstrated via the challenge-driven process.\nScope:\nGenerative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe\u2019s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.\nUser industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide to the competing FSTP recipients the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small team of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\nStage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow to select for Stage 2 the 20 highest-ranked proposals, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations led by such SME\nStage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 20 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3\u2013 Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,000,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, an amount of EUR 5,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge.\nThe proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects[1] and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.

They will position the Union at the forefront of regulatory innovation, while strengthening the functioning, resilience, competitiveness, and digital leadership of the Single Market.\nEnhance the excellence and competitiveness of companies, professionals, and public administrations by providing innovative, automated solutions to navigate and comply with Union rules seamlessly across borders.\nEnhance public services and strengthen the competitiveness and digital sovereignty of the EU by improved availability and use of high-quality real and synthetic data to train AI systems more effectively.\nScope:\nThe scope of this topic is to support the deployment of secure, interoperable, and scalable data management systems, ensuring seamless cross-sector data integration, automation of key processes, and compliance with EU frameworks.\nThe actions should deliver high-quality, well-structured, secure and compliant data, tailored to evolving societal, industrial, research and public sector needs, underpinning key EU strategies, including the Data Union Strategy, the Apply AI Strategy, the Digital Justice Strategy, and the development of Common European Data Spaces, Data Labs and EuroHPC systems (including the AI Factories). The developed methods, technologies and tools should ensure that data is effectively shared between sectors, disciplines, and participating countries, and that the data is reliable, traceable, and fit for purpose.\nThe proposal should clearly state (in the abstract and in the introduction) which of the following two areas it addresses. A proposal can address both areas, but it should indicate one of them as the main focus of the proposal, as it will be evaluated accordingly under that area:\nArea 1: The actions under this area should support the development and deployment of advanced, AI-driven compliance technologies and solutions that automate data transactions and key regulatory processes, reduce administrative burdens, and facilitate seamless adherence to EU rules. This includes RegTech/GovTech//LegalTech applications such as digital tools offering real-time compliance guidance, automated rule-drafting assistants for policymakers, and multilingual chatbots providing regulatory support to businesses and professionals. Predictive analytics and risk-based approaches should allow tailored compliance pathways, while integration with national systems and the Single Digital Gateway should promote cross-border mutual recognition and application of the Once-Only Principle. Public administrations should be equipped with automated compliance assessment tools, real-time analytics dashboards, and interoperability frameworks to enhance and streamline regulatory oversight and cooperation. The technologies and solutions should contribute to the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency in AI-driven compliance solutions, including traceability and explainability of automated actions.\nThe solutions under Area 1 should adhere to open technical standards, ensuring scalability, inclusiveness, and co-development with private and public stakeholders. Robust cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, trust safeguards, security and privacy cryptographic protection, including via post-quantum cryptography, should be embedded, aligning with EU data protection and digital identity frameworks. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models should be harnessed, to the extent possible/reasonable, to enable data-driven feedback loops that support continuous policy learning, allowing regulators to monitor rule implementation, identify unnecessary burdens, and simplify legislation based on real-time evidence. Where appropriate, the actions under this Area should build on and integrate the privacy-enhancing (including anonymization) technologies developed under earlier topics in the Horizon Europe programme.\nArea 2: The actions under this area should focus on the design and deployment of secure, scalable, and adaptive data management systems that automate key data processes, such as data curation, metadata tagging, ontology management and discovery, labelling, annotation, and quality control, developing and adapting appropriate AI methods and tools for these specific tasks. These systems should facilitate seamless integration and sharing of data across sectors and disciplines, ensuring interoperability, data provenance, data privacy and handling secured against emerging quantum threats via post-quantum cryptography, and compliance with applicable EU legal frameworks. Special emphasis is on enhancing data accuracy, representativeness, and relevance, particularly for use cases in industry, public services, citizen engagement, and the development of trustworthy AI applications, as well as the Common European Data Spaces. The development of such high-quality, semantically rich datasets will be essential to unlock the full potential of AI across domains.\nFurthermore, the actions under Area 2 may also support the generation and use of high-quality synthetic data, including spatial synthetic data, to complement real-world datasets while preserving data privacy via advanced, state-of-the-art cryptographic protection. This may include, among others, the use of AI-enabled generative graphics pipelines to automate the creation of large-scale simulated environments and the application of parallelised and/or neuromorphic computing techniques to train AI models and artificial agents efficiently.\nThe actions under both areas should take into account the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre, particularly the blueprint for common European data spaces, and build synergies with related Union initiatives such as AI Factories, European Blockchain Services infrastructure, and the European Business Wallet, as well as with sector-specific Common European Data Spaces, and EU Digital Identity Wallet large scale pilots. Close collaboration with relevant European Partnerships, stakeholders, including industry, public administrations, and research organisations, will ensure that the systems meet the practical needs of data users while fostering innovation, competitiveness, and digital sovereignty within the Single Market.\n\nTopic updates\n15 January 2026\nThe submission session is now available for: HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-18, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-17, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-HUMAN-02, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-03, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-08, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-06, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DATA-02, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-12, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-09, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-11, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-19, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-HUMAN-01, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-14, HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-15",

Current state-of-the-art technologies have already paved the way for more streamlined operations, yet there remains untapped value in e.g. quality improvement, definition of optimal process operating conditions, reduction of scrap, optimization of energy usage. Real-time monitoring and adaptive optimisation using AI models can enable agile responses to production variability and support sustained, high-performance operations.\nNew solutions based on innovative enabling technologies such as deep learning, large language models, digital twins, synthetic data, and data-driven models allow manufacturers to improve production system efficiency, elevate product quality, and proactively address critical challenges in energy consumption and carbon footprint. This dual focus on operational excellence and sustainability ensures that factories can maintain competitive advantage while also contributing to specific environmental goals, e.g. reducing the pressure on ecosystems and natural resources. Since innovation capacity and competitiveness also requires a systemic understanding of an organization\u2019s value creating structure, novel AI solutions should be implemented such that they can support all structures and phases of operation, in technical and non-technical terms.\nProposals should produce dedicated innovative explainable AI based solutions in advanced manufacturing for at least two of the following:\nimprove processes and operational efficiency, and reduce climate and environmental impact of processes and factories through dynamic selection of optimal processes and production parameters, exploiting AI for process modelling and/or optimisation;\navoid the production of defective parts using AI to detect process drift and anomalies and correct proactively defects in real time; and\nmaximise the fraction of regenerated components or materials used in the production using AI to optimise the material flow.\nProposals should demonstrate potential for these AI tools to adapt to changing production needs and real-time data, and should describe how industrial data access, confidentiality, and secure data-sharing will be addressed.\nProjects are encouraged to link with AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in Testing and Experiment Facilities (TEFs), and further deployed via European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nProposals can optionally address the conditions for implementing the novel AI solutions within an organisations structure and value creating models, thereby contributing to systemic approach of implementing a smart organisation.\nThis topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination \u2018Leadership in materials and production for Europe\u2019.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.\nTechnology Readiness Level - Technology readiness level expected from completed projects\nActivities are expected to start at TRL 4-5 and achieve TRL 6 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B.\n\nTopic updates\n23 December 2025\nThe technical issue affecting the upload of part B to the proposal submission tool has now been resolved.\n18 December 2025\nDear Applicants,\nPlease note that, due to a technical issue, it is currently not possible to upload part B to the proposal submission tool.

            "description": "Expected Outcome:\nWhile today\u2019s AI agents still have limited capabilities, advances in model architecture, memory, reasoning, and autonomous behaviour are paving the way to unlocking their potential across economic sectors. The Apply AI Strategy[1]acknowledges this trend and the need to advance research on next-generation AI agents. Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:\nSignificant improvements in the autonomy, robustness and reliability of AI agents through advanced planning mechanisms, memory management, and reasoning capabilities.\nInnovative multi-agent frameworks and protocols demonstrating effective decentralized coordination and collaboration among multiple AI agents beyond the capabilities of individual agents.\nScope:\nNext-generation AI agents are autonomous systems powered by large AI language models (e.g., large language models or large multimodal models), that can plan, utilize tools and perform actions autonomously to achieve specified goals based on high-level instructions. The large AI model acts as the agent's \"brain,\" capable of interpreting instructions, generating plans, and using tools. This capability enables agents to autonomously plan and adapt behaviour in real-time to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. AI Agents hold significant promise in numerous applications areas such as data analytics and coding.\nEffective AI agents require careful design, incorporating structured planning and reasoning methods to manage complex tasks, and be equipped with appropriate validation and monitoring techniques. Multi-agent collaboration frameworks further enhance capabilities by enabling structured interactions among multiple agents.\nKey aspects in designing effective AI agents include robust planning, reasoning, and search mechanisms that allow agents to approach complex tasks by breaking them down into structured subgoals. Effective memory and state management are necessary to maintaining coherent long-term interactions, achieved through a balanced integration of short-term and external long-term memory solutions. Moreover, integrating external tools and APIs is essential for overcoming limitations in large AI models, enhancing agent performance in tasks requiring accuracy and reliability.\nPotential research areas include enhancing AI agent autonomy through advanced self-planning and self-optimization capabilities, enabling agents to improve their decision-making and strategic planning. Other research directions include innovation in memory-augmented AI agents to facilitate robust long-term reasoning and lifelong learning; developing advanced multi-agent frameworks specifically tailored for collaborative agents, including research on AI agent frameworks based on mixed AI architectures, and advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities to enable real-world applications.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform.\nProjects selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub. Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.\n[1] COM xxxx(2025) Apply AI Strategy - PLACEHOLDER\n\nTopic updates\n15 January 2026\nThe submission session is now available for: HORIZON-CL4-2026-05-MAT-PROD-25, HORIZON-CL4-2026-05-DIGITAL-EMERGING-02, HORIZON-CL4-2026-05-DIGITAL-EMERGING-03",
