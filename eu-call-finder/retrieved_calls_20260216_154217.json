      "description": "Expected Outcome:\nOutcomes and deliverables\nGains from Investment in key capacities can only materialise if there are enough people to design, deploy and use them. At present, all Member States face shortages of digital specialists and the training opportunities in digital areas are missing in the EU, compared to other countries. Specialised courses, such as Master’s courses in domains like Artificial Intelligence are not uniformly available in all Member States and concentrated in some regions.\nThe action will contribute to expand the education offer across Europe, by increasing the number of courses, jointly designed by universities from different Member States and associated countries together with excellence centres and businesses active in the domain. The impact will be twofold: an increase of courses offer all over the EU and the development of dynamic digital ecosystems where academic excellence, research and innovative industries work together to attract and retain the best talents worldwide.\nObjective:\nThe action aims at increasing and improving the offer of education programmes and the number of students specialised in key capacity areas. The offer will be expanded in terms of geographical distribution (including outermost regions and other disadvantaged regions), number of opportunities and relevance to latest technological developments. The actions also aim at supporting more inter-disciplinary courses that can equip professionals with relevant advanced digital skills and increase diversity among students and future digital experts (for example data analytics skills for professionals in different sectors). The action will support cooperation between higher education institutions and the private sector, together with research and excellence centres in digital technologies, including those funded in the other actions of the programme. The goal is to encourage organisations to work together and develop ecosystems of excellence able to train, attract and retain the best digital talents, including by contributing to closing the gender gap in these fields (latest available data from ESTAT report that women represent only 18.5 % of ICT specialists in the EU). This action will contribute to the implementation of the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.\nScope:\nThe chosen projects shall design and deliver a tertiary degree education programme of 60, 90 or 120 academic credits (The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System - ECTS). The calls in the first two years will address the following topics: Data, Internet of Things (IoT), AI, Blockchain, cybersecurity, HPC, quantum, among others and interdisciplinary courses, including the teaching of the above areas in a non-ICT education field (e.g. AI applications for agriculture or cybersecurity and law etc..). Proposals can address only one technological areas, or more, or only one inter-disciplinary programme, with a specific focus on one sector. Tertiary education institutions in consortia with relevant competence and excellence centres and industry will receive funding to set up and strengthen excellent courses in the above areas. Partners in these consortia will be encouraged to share expertise, facilities, staff and learning material Inter-sectorial mobility between Higher Education Institutions and the private sector is also encouraged. These courses need to reflect the latest state of the art of the technologies, provide opportunities to students to have access to laboratories and testing and experimentation facilities and making use-where appropriate- of the EU data spaces. They will also make use of digital technologies to provide learning experiences that are flexible in time, scope end place, as appropriate. Activities to exchange on good practices to involve and interact with external stakeholders will also be encouraged. Particular attention shall be given to aspects such as green application and environmental impact of these technologies. The projects should also aim at increasing diversity among participants to the courses and ensure that experts will be trained to detect and prevent bias in the future developments.\nThe following activities can be eligible for funding, among others:\npartnerships for higher education institution, research/excellence centres in digital technologies and innovative businesses. They will need to be sustainable over time and show a high degree of integration. Actors involved in the partnership will need to define a common education and training agenda that could result not only in an improved offer for students, with clear learning outcomes, but also increase their international attractiveness; adequate measures of quality assurance and quality monitoring, as well as activities leading to mutual learning and exchange of good practices, will be implemented;\nupgrading technical equipment, to ensure that students have access to the latest technologies available in the market and improve facilities, as well as explore innovative ways to use technology in teaching and learning;\ntackling the shortage of teaching staff and providing access to high quality teaching; incentives could be provided for professors, experts and top researchers in digital areas to contribute to the teaching activities;\nproviding support to students, via scholarships or fee waivers in order to allow everyone to have access to high-quality education in digital areas and to increase diversity in education and research.\nDelegation to Agencies:\nImplementation: Executive Agency\n\nTopic updates\n24 June 2022\n The Commission has now completed the evaluation of the proposals submitted under this topic.\n  The results of the evaluation are as follows:\nDIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED\n  Number of proposals submitted:\n16\nNumber of inadmissible proposals:\n0\nNumber of ineligible proposals:\n7\nNumber of above-threshold proposals:\n9\nTotal budget requested for above-threshold proposals:\nEUR 56.473.434\n  We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals.\nIt is expected that the first grant agreements will be signed by 22.11.2022.\n24 June 2022\n  The Commission has now completed the evaluation of the proposals submitted to the above-mentioned call.\nThe results of the evaluation are as follows:\nDIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED\n  Number of proposals submitted:\n16\nNumber of inadmissible proposals:\n0\nNumber of ineligible proposals:\n7\nNumber of above-threshold proposals:\n9\nTotal budget requested for above-threshold proposals:\nEUR 56.473.434\n  DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-ANALYSIS\n  Number of proposals submitted:\n5\nNumber of inadmissible proposals:\n0\nNumber of ineligible proposals:\n0\nNumber of above-threshold proposals:\n3\nTotal budget requested for above-threshold proposals:\nEUR 2.000.000\n  We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals.\n  It is expected that the first grant agreements will be signed by 22.11.2022.\n01 June 2022\n A total of 21 proposals were submitted under this call.   \nBelow is the breakdown of number of proposals submitted per topic:\n  DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-ANALYSIS     -   5 proposals submitted \nDIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED  - 16 proposals submitted\n17 November 2021\nThe submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-ANALYSIS(DIGITAL-CSA), DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED(DIGITAL-SIMPLE)",

      "description": "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nthe capacities and integrated governance of researchers, decision-makers, practitioners, local communities and other stakeholders to effectively collaborate to prevent, eradicate or manage invasive alien species (IAS) are enhanced;\nnative ecosystems are better protected, leading to improved resilience and continuous provision of ecosystem services including for climate mitigation and adaptation.\nScope:\nInvasive alien species are one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. Besides inflicting major damage to nature and the economy, many invasive alien species also facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and native wildlife. The rate of new introductions of invasive alien species has increased in recent years. Without effective control measures, risks to our nature and health will continue to rise. Climate change and land-use changes facilitate the spread and establishment of many alien species.\nProposals are expected to support the prevention, eradication and/or management of invasive alien species by stakeholders, including adaptive management approaches. This topic is related to target 12 the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species) and to target 6 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: reduce the introduction of Invasive Alien Species by 50% by 2030 and minimize their impact. Proposals should support the implementation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the EU regulation on invasive alien species and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the IPBES assessment on invasive alien species (2023)[1]. All ecosystem types (terrestrial, fresh and/or marine waters) may be addressed.\nLiving labs can empower the green transition by co-creating solutions and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.\nSuccessful proposals should:\nset up at least three living labs, composed each of 10 to 20 experimental sites, following the three main principles: (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users. Transboundary living labs are encouraged and living labs are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries;\nestablish a detailed work plan of the activities to be undertaken in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions. Where appropriate, activities should advance knowledge on invasive alien species to support the development of solutions;\nconduct participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs with the objectives of:\nbuilding on existing methods (including ensuring the integration of existing solutions) or developing new ones for detecting and monitoring invasive alien species, such as the use of citizen science, eDNA, remote sensing and machine learning algorithms, and test them at scale. Proposals could build on pilots developed by the European partnership Biodiversa+;\ndesigning and testing innovative eradication and management strategies and methods which may include, for instance, physical removal and the use of biological control or chemical control. Innovative tools such as bio-engineering might be explored in conjunction with more traditional methods. Range shifts induced by climate change should be considered;\nmonitor and carry out an assessment of the innovative strategies, methods and tools and their effectiveness. Measures to ensure the prevention of re-invasion should be considered as well, to secure the continued effectiveness of the proposed solutions;\ndisseminate the newly developed solutions, to facilitate their uptake by practitioners;\nprovide data and experience usable for decision-makers, to assess socio-economic impacts of invasive alien species, side-effects of the management, the cost of inaction and the benefits of eradication or effective management, with effective contribution from social sciences and humanities;\naddress challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions. A gender-sensitive and inclusive approach should be integrated, examining how invasive alien species affect individuals’ livelihoods and well-being differently.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline to enhance the societal impact of the research activities.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly for real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to store and give access to research data should be considered. A citizen science approach could be appropriate for this action to produce, collect and analyse data.\nFinancial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nProposals should cooperate with the Joint Research Centre to use the resources of and make results available to, when relevant, the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN).\nProposals should ensure cooperation with relevant initiatives of the European partnership Biodiversa+ and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures[2] as well as related projects in the environment domain. International cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] IPBES (2023).

      "destination": "Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (2026-27)\nThis destination will mostly support the EU Commission priority ‘Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature’.\nThe implementation of the EU Green Deal[1] will continue to guide R&I in this destination. R&I will develop knowledge and tools to support the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030[2] and notably the EU Nature Restoration Regulation[3], including with the development of nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap[4]. This destination will also address the EU proposal for a Directive on soil monitoring and resilience[5], the EU proposal for a Regulation on a forest monitoring framework[6] and will inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy after 2030, thus protecting our natural world. Nature-based Solutions are deep-rooted in this destination, which will support the EU climate adaptation strategy[7] and the EU climate mitigation targets by maintaining or improving natural carbon sinks, since natural ecosystems store large amounts of carbon globally and ecosystems’ carbon sequestration potential is tightly linked to their biological diversity. R&I should particularly assess the ecosystems ongoing ability to sequester carbon and, if necessary, focus more on ecosystems that reliably do so while also providing benefits to biodiversity.\nActions will contribute to the European Ocean Pact[8], to the European Water Resilience Strategy[9] and to the EU legislative proposal on pollutants in EU waters[10] (update of chemical substances listed for control).\nR&I activities for sustainable farming, fishing and aquaculture will be supported in alignment with the Vision for Agriculture and Food[11], the Vision for Fisheries and Aquaculture towards 2040[12], as well as with the environmental objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy[13] and the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production[14]. These efforts will enhance biodiversity and climate-resilient farming practices, ensuring the long-term competitiveness of these sectors within ecological boundaries, and foster innovation to drive sustainable food production.\nR&I actions under this destination will encourage international cooperation in line with the global approach on R&I, contributing to EU international biodiversity commitments, notably those taken under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)[15], which defines targets for the medium term (2030) and goals for the long term (2050). This destination will also support the Paris Agreement[16], the Sustainable Development Goals[17] and the United Nations agreement on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement)[18]. Support to processes of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)[19] will be continued.\nComplementarities and synergies will be ensured with the activities supported by the co-funded partnerships Biodiversa+[20], Water4All[21] and the co-funded partnership on Agroecology[22], and LIFE[23] projects, particularly on nature restoration and protection.\nThe destination supports unlocking the unique assets for research and innovation of the EU outermost regions, in line with the EU strategy for outermost regions[24].\nExpected impact: Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to “putting biodiversity on a path to recovery, and protecting and restoring ecosystems and their services”, and more specifically to one or more of the following expected impacts:\nKnowledge on biodiversity status and trends and drivers of biodiversity loss is improved;\nInnovations, methods, pathways, models and tools are available and used to protect healthy and resilient ecosystems and to restore degraded ones, ensuring the continuous provision of ecosystem services, including for adaptation and/or mitigation to climate change;\nThe ongoing biodiversity crisis and its consequences, notably on ecosystem functioning and their services, and the need to monitor, protect, restore and sustainably use biodiversity are better understood to better benefit the whole society in an inclusive way;\nPolicymakers and stakeholders, all relevant economic sectors and society are aware and well informed of relevant challenges and opportunities of biodiversity protection, restoration and sustainable use, leading to better implementation of the biodiversity legislation and better valuation of ecosystem services, leading to transformative change towards a nature positive economy;\nFarmers, foresters, land and sea managers, fishers and aquaculture producers have access to key information, and test and implement biodiversity-friendly management practices, while safeguarding food and water security and fostering competitiveness, demonstrating the long-term sustainability of these sectors;\nProgress towards international commitments worldwide on biodiversity is made.\n[1] The European Green Deal - European Commission\n[2] Biodiversity strategy for 2030 - European Commission\n[3] Regulation - EU - 2024/1991 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[4] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[5] EUR-Lex - 52023PC0416 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[6] Proposal for a Regulation on a Forest Monitoring Framework - European Commission\n[7] EU Adaptation Strategy - European Commission\n[8] The European Ocean Pact - European Commission\n[9] Water resilience strategy - European Commission\n[10] EUR-Lex - 52022PC0540 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[11] Vision for Agriculture and Food - European Commission\n[12] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0075 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[13] Key policy objectives of the CAP 2023-27 - European Commission\n[14] Organic action plan - European Commission\n[15] Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\n[16] The Paris Agreement | UNFCCC\n[17] THE 17 GOALS | Sustainable Development\n[18] BBNJ Agreement | Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction\n[19] IPBES Home page | IPBES secretariat\n[20] Biodiversa +\n[21] Water Security for the Planet\n[22] Agroecology Partnership\n[23] LIFE - European Commission\n[24] COM(2022) Putting people first, securing sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions",

      "description": "Expected Outcome:\nIn line with the EU Common Fisheries Policy and the revised EU Fisheries Control Regulation, the European Ocean Pact, the Vision for Fisheries and Aquaculture with a 2040 perspective, the strategic guidelines for sustainable and competitive aquaculture, the EU algae initiative, Farm to Fork Strategy, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the Food 2030 policy framework, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\neconomic prosperity is fostered in coastal, rural and urban communities through improved business models, value chain integration and market access for small scale producers that can contribute offering attractive jobs;\nconsumers benefit from the availability of locally produced, nutritious, and safe aquatic food following high environmental and social standards;\nmore resilient and empowered communities at local and regional levels by fostering innovation in aquatic food value chain and addressing challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource management;\na more competitive and sustainable aquatic food sector by advancing ecosystem-based management practices, digitalization and technological innovation based on the latest scientific research.\nScope:\nSmall-scale aquatic food production includes small-scale fisheries, recreational fisheries and aquaculture farms that are classified as SMEs. In 2021, small-scale fisheries contributed to 49% of employment in EU fisheries. Together with other maritime activities, small-scale fisheries play a vital role in local economies, particularly in the Mediterranean, where over half of the sector is concentrated. Recreational fisheries are non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport. While the marketing or sale of catches from recreational fisheries is prohibited, if properly monitored and managed they can contribute to conservation efforts and support community development. According to the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, the aquaculture sector in the EU consists primarily of small and family-owned enterprises- especially in the case of mollusk farms. However, small-scale actors often face difficulties in developing and adopting innovative technologies.\nSelected proposals should advance knowledge and develop tools, including Nature-based Solutions, for managing and further developing small-scale aquatic food production. They should include, where relevant, both aspects of natural science and technical know-how to improve small-scale aquatic food production as well as issues related to social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. In the frame of SSH, cultural elements such as local traditions related to aquatic food production and consumption could be included. The scope of the topic includes fisheries and aquaculture activities taking place in fresh, brackish and marine waters, such as small-scale fisheries, small-scale mollusk, seaweed and fish farms, recreational fisheries, urban aquaculture and aquaponics.\nSelected proposals should develop innovative methodologies to assess environmental and socio-economic contributions of relevant small-scale actors to the prosperity of local communities within the broader aquatic food system, taking into account a gender sensitive approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations. This could, for example, include diverse data sources (e.g. citizen science, social media) and advance data processing, validation, and interoperability solutions using for example AI, machine learning, and big data analytics to provide actionable insights.\nThe effects of climate change on small-scale aquatic food production should be addressed as well as the potential contribution of small-scale aquatic food production to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, the potential for environmental services provision and of improvements of ecological footprint should be explored. Aquatic animal welfare issues should be considered, where relevant.\nSelected proposals should include from their design throughout their development and implementation relevant stakeholders and end-users and produce outputs that can be readily applicable by them. Special attention should be given to knowledge transfer, training, and capacity-building activities to ensure the practical implementation of research findings and innovations by small-scale actors and policymakers.\nnull\nActivities are expected to achieve TRL 6-7 by the end of the project – see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL.",
      "destination": "Fair, healthy and environment-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption (2026-27)\nThis destination will support the EU Commission priority ‘Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature’.\nR&I will provide new knowledge and innovation in support of the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, built on the recommendations of the Strategic Dialogue on Agriculture, to ensure the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of our farming, fisheries, aquaculture and food sector within the boundaries of our planet. The implementation of the Green Deal actions will continue to guide R&I in this destination to foster sustainable food systems, addressing potential trade-offs between economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability.\nThe R&I activities under this Destination will contribute to the ambitious objectives of the current CAP concerning the competitiveness and sustainability of feed, food and non-food production as well as additional future CAP policy priorities. More specifically, actions will contribute to the specific objectives of the CAP; EU action plan for the development of organic production; food safety regulations; sustainable use of pesticides requirements under the plant protection products framework; action plan against antimicrobial resistance; animal health and welfare legislations; legislative and non-legislative initiatives to enhance cooperation of primary producers and improve their competitiveness and position in the food chain; protein strategy; contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security and communications on food security and fertilizers, the Nature Restoration Regulation, the Zero Pollution Action Plan.\nR&I will also support the announced Vision for the Fisheries Sector with a 2040 perspective and the European Ocean Pact, a framework of coherence across all policies linked to the ocean. R&I will also be relevant to the outcomes of the evaluation of the common fisheries policy (CFP) and will support its placement under this Pact, as fisheries and aquaculture are affected by other ocean related policies.\nAn important driving force of food systems transformation should be the integration of sectors, actors (including citizens and consumers) and policies. This will involve a better understanding of the multiple interactions between the components of current food systems, to foster solutions that maximise co-benefits with respect to the priorities of Food 2030[1].\nThe EU Communication on Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the[2] EU provides an overview of the application of biotechnologies in several sectors including food and feed. R&I activities in this destination will also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Strategy for European Life Sciences, the EU Biotech Act, and the new EU bioeconomy strategy.\nThe Destination supports unlocking the unique assets for research and innovation of the EU outermost regions, in line with the EU strategy for outermost regions[3].\nExpected impact: Proposals for topics under this destination should set out credible paths to “ensuring healthy food and nutrition security by making agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and food systems sustainable, resilient, inclusive and within planetary boundaries”. More specifically, proposed topics should contribute to one or more of the following expected impacts:\nagriculture and food systems contribute to ensuring a secure, safe, sustainable, nutritious, and affordable supply of healthy food in Europe and beyond by fostering its long-term competitiveness, resilience, scalability and sustainability within the boundaries of our planet with the One Health approach;\nfarmers are empowered to ensure the competitiveness, resilience and sustainability of the farming sector, through increasing knowledge, tools, innovative solutions, and advice that allow efficient productivity, working for and with nature, preserving and restoring biodiversity within agricultural ecosystems and helping to decarbonise the EU economy;\nsustainable fisheries and aquaculture (in marine, brackish and freshwater) contribute to fair, healthy, resilient and environment-friendly food systems in healthy aquatic ecosystems with thriving diversity of species and habitats providing ecosystem and climate services and triggering growth and jobs’ creation in coastal and rural areas;\ntools are provided so that citizens and communities are empowered to make the sustainable food choices and move towards safe, healthy, nutritious, accessible, affordable and sustainable diets. Insights and advances in life science and digital & data technologies are valorised to deploy solutions in practice across the EU;\nfood businesses, including food processing industries and SMEs, are supported to increase their resilience and competitiveness, while ensuring resource efficiency and sustainability, and human, animal and ecosystem health is preserved.\n[1] The four priorities of Food2030 are: 1) nutrition and health; 2) climate and environmental sustainability; 3) circularity and resource efficiency; and 4) innovation and empowering communities.\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024DC0137.\n[3] COM(2022) Putting people first, securing sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions.",
